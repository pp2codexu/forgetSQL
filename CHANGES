Version 0.5.2.rc1  
-----------------
2006-06-02

Added new field _autosave for disabling garbage collection time saving.
    
    # By default, autosave change when object is garbage collected.
    # NOTE: This could give weird side affects as you need to keep track
    # on when objects are garbage collected. Instead, use .save()
    # explicitely when you want to save. By default, for backward
    # compatibility, autosave is on.
    _autosave = True

It is recommended to disable _autosave and use .save(), as relying on
garbage collection for persistance is not reliable. This is now the
default behaviour in modules made by the generator.


The code syntax has been cleaned up with 4-space indention and proper
headers. 


Corrected a bug that _changed was not reset on save, so that objects
that was changed once, was forever doomed to be saved again. (Thanks to
Morten Vold)


_loadDB() now close the cursor after loading the row, previous behaviour
could have given trouble with some DB drivers.


Added an iterator version of getChildren(), getChildrenIterator(). In
general, it is advicable to use the get*Iterator methods for
performance reasons. (Thanks to Morten Vold)


generateFromTables() moved from forgetsql-generate, and is now available
as a library function.


Moved from CVS to Subversion on Sourceforge. New address is
https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/forgetsql.
